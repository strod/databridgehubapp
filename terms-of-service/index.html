                    <h5 class="wp-block-heading">Updated 17 May 2023</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) including its appendices listed below, order form and/or any other agreement constitutes the entire agreement (“Agreement”) between the Customer or You and Data Bridge Hub Oy or a Data Bridge Hub affiliate as set out in the Agreement (”Data Bridge Hub” or “we,” “our” or “us”), regarding your use of our services specified in the Terms (the software, and services are collectively referred to as the “Service”). Please read these Terms carefully. You may authorize your employees or other individual authorized users (collectively, “Authorized Users”) to use the Service. You agree that you are fully responsible with respect to any use of the Service by an Authorized User, including any breach by an Authorized User of these Terms.</p>
                    <p>The following appendices forms an inseparable part of and is governed by the terms of these Terms of Service:</p>
                    <p><a href="#dpa" style="color: aliceblue;">Annex 1: Data Processing Agreement</a></p>
                    <p>In the event of any conflicting terms in the Terms and its appendices, the Terms shall take precedence over the appendices, except in any matters relating to the processing of personal data, in which case Annex 1 (Data Processing Agreement) shall take precedence.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. The Service</h4>
                    <p>The Service is an analytics and reporting solution that helps customers collect their online data for reporting, analysis and active data management. The Service is provided only electronically through user interfaces on third party platforms, for example through an add-in or add-on functionality, and through interfaces hosted by Data Bridge Hub.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Eligibility</h4>
                    <p>The Service is not intended for users that are consumers (being an individual acting primarily for purposes other than a trade, business or profession) and the applicability of consumer protection legislation is therefore excluded. You must be 18 years of age or older to enter into this agreement and use the Service. You represent and warrant that any information you submit is true and accurate and that you are 18 years of age or older and are fully able and competent to enter into, and abide by these Terms, and that you have the authority to bind the Customer entity listed on the Agreement, if applicable.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Account Registration</h4>
                    <p>All Authorized Users must register to use the Service. You agree to, and cause all Authorized Users to: (a) provide accurate, current and complete information as may be prompted by registration forms on the Service (“<strong>Registration Data</strong>”); (b) maintain the security of, and not share with any third party, any logins, passwords, or other credentials that you or any Authorized User selects or that are provided to you or any Authorized User for use on the Service; (c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you or any Authorized User provides to us, and to keep all such information accurate, current, and complete; and (d) notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of any Authorized User account or any other breach of security by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:contact@rodtex.dev" style="color: aliceblue;">privacy@rodtex.dev</a>.&nbsp; Any activity on an Authorized User’s account shall be the sole responsibility of the Customer.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Free Trial</h4>
                    <p>We may at our sole discretion offer you free trials for selected features of the Service or a limited time trial period of the entire Service. Once your free trial period ends, your ability to access the Service will terminate. Data Bridge Hub reserves the right to determine if you are eligible for a free trial and to discontinue any free trial without notice at our sole discretion.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Fees and payment</h4>
                    <p>Access to selected features of the Service may be provided to you free of charge. We will charge fees for certain features, either on a one-time or a subscription basis (“Paid Services”). Data Bridge Hub reserves the right to implement fees or change the fees at any time by providing you notice on the Service or otherwise. If you have signed an order form with Data Bridge Hub for Paid Services and the subscription is automatically renewable, Data Bridge Hub reserves the right to increase the fees by eight (8) % annually, which shall apply at each renewal date of subscription. When you purchase any Paid Services, you authorize Data Bridge Hub or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card identified by you (which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use) all applicable fees for your purchase, including all applicable taxes, and you agree that our payment provider can store your credit card information. If Data Bridge Hub does not receive payment from your credit card provider, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand and Data Bridge Hub may suspend your access to the Services until full payment is received or terminate the Terms of Service. All sales are final and Data Bridge Hub will not issue refunds, including for prepaid monthly fees. If you choose an automatic recurring payment and later decide to end your subscription, cancelling the payment is your responsibility. Data Bridge Hub does not refund automatic payments not cancelled in time.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Access; Use Restrictions</h4>
                    <p>Data Bridge Hub hereby grants you the right to access and use the Service, subject to your compliance with these Terms at all times, including timely payment of all applicable fees. Your right to access and use the Service is personal, limited to your internal business purposes, non-transferable, non-exclusive, and revocable. With the tools provided by Data Bridge Hub, you may create additional connectors to the Service (“Custom Connector(s)”), which you may use solely with the Service to support your permitted use of the Service.</p>
                    <p>Your access and use of the Service are based on the Service client, data source, data destination and usage restrictions. Access and use may be restricted to one individual, company, your Data Bridge Hub team or specific data access/usage. There may be additional restrictions, which may change from time to time, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of impending changes in a timely manner. Specific written agreements for access and usage restrictions will be indicated in the Agreement and they will override these Terms.</p>
                    <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not, will not attempt to, and will not permit or encourage any third party to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain improper access to any software component of the Service, in whole or in part;</li>
                        <li>modify or create derivative works of the Service, in whole or in part (except for Custom Connectors);</li>
                        <li>use the Service in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any intellectual property right or other right of any third party including but not limited to accessing Custom Connector Services for which you have no rights or in violation of the terms of Custom Connector Services;</li>
                        <li>interfere with or disrupt the integrity of the Service or any content or data contained therein or transmitted thereby;</li>
                        <li>access, monitor, or copy any content or information on the Service using any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means or any manual process for any purpose without our express written permission;</li>
                        <li>violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers on the Service or bypass or circumvent other measures employed to prevent or limit access to the Service;</li>
                        <li>take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;</li>
                        <li>deep-link to any portion of the Service for any purpose without our express written permission;</li>
                        <li>“frame”, “mirror,” sell, resell, rent, or lease any portion of the Service or otherwise incorporate any part of the Service into any other website without our prior written authorization;</li>
                        <li>input any virus, malware, or other harmful code into the Service;</li>
                        <li>use the Service or any Data Bridge Hub Confidential Information for benchmarking or competitive analysis with respect to competitive or related products or services or to develop, commercialize, license, or sell any product, service, or technology that could, directly or indirectly, compete with the Service; or</li>
                        <li>violate any applicable local, provincial national, or international law or regulation.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We may at any time suspend or terminate your or any Authorized User’s access to the Service if we have reason to believe that you are not complying with the Terms or you are otherwise abusing the Service.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Third-party services, data and content</h4>
                    <p>7.1 The Service allows you to gather data from multiple third-party data sources and services, including various third-party websites (jointly “<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”). The Third-Party Services from which the data can be gathered are selected by Data Bridge Hub at its sole discretion and Data Bridge Hub may, during the Term, change the Third-Party Services that are compatible with the Service. In addition, Data Bridge Hub may discontinue the compatible Third-Party Services if the applicable service providers of the Third-Party Services discontinue the relevant services or discontinue making such services available to Data Bridge Hub. If you create Custom Connectors to access third-party services of your choice (“Custom Connector Services”), you shall be solely liable for accessing such Custom Connector Services. Data Bridge Hub shall have a right to discontinue your use of Custom Connector Services, if you breach the terms of this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>7.2 Data Bridge Hub assumes no liability whatsoever for the data or other content collected from Third-Party Services, such as Facebook, Google Analytics and Google Ads or from Custom Connector Services. You are solely responsible for ascertaining that you have the right to use the Service for gathering and processing any such data by using the Service, and you must obtain any such consents and authorizations as may be needed from time to time in relation to such data or other content and their processing by using the Service. We do not assume any liability for such Third-Party Services, Custom Connector Services or software, and you are exclusively responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses or consents needed for their use. You must familiarize yourself with the applicable terms and conditions, including any restrictions on use, in relation to any such Third-Party Services and Custom Connector Services and you agree to comply with the third-party terms and conditions applicable to the Third-Party Services and Custom Connector Services in addition to the terms of the Agreement.</p>
                    <p>7.3 Furthermore, the Service may contain links to web pages and content of third parties as a service to those interested in this information. We do not monitor, endorse, or adopt, or have any control over any third-party web pages or content. We undertake no responsibility to update or review any such web pages or third-party content and can make no guarantee as to its accuracy or completeness. Additionally, if you follow a link or otherwise navigate away from the Service, please be aware that these Terms will no longer govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any web page, third-party content or service provider to which you navigate from the Service. You access and use third-party content at your own risk.</p>
                    <p>7.4With respect to Google services, our tools will only have rights to access your Google Analytics/Ads/YouTube data (depending on which service you are logging in to), and nothing else on your Google account. You can revoke Data Bridge Hub’ right to access your data at any point from your Google account control panel (<a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions</a>).</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Modifications to the Service</h4>
                    <p>You acknowledge that Data Bridge Hub may make modifications to the Service during the Term without prior notice to you; however, Data Bridge Hub will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any material changes to the Service in advance.&nbsp; In the event of material changes to the Service, Data Bridge Hub may provide further instructions to you with respect to any actions required by you in order to continue access and use of the Service, if necessary.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Subcontractors</h4>
                    <p>Data Bridge Hub may engage subcontractors to perform the Service under the Agreement, provided that Data Bridge Hub remains fully liable for any actions of such subcontractors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Data Bridge Hub shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any of its hosting service or data communication service providers.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">10. Term and Termination</h4>
                    <p>10.1 Your account and subscription of the Service remains in effect unless you terminate it or unless Data Bridge Hub terminates your account as provided by these Terms. Your account and subscription of the Service may, depending on your choice, be automatically renewable or valid for a fixed period. If your subscription is automatically renewable, your subscription to the Service will remain in effect and will be renewed automatically at the end of each subscription period unless you terminate your subscription or we terminate it.</p>
                    <p>If your subscription is made for a fixed period and/or not automatically renewable, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the agreed subscription period.</p>
                    <p>Upon the termination or expiration of the Agreement, you must immediately stop using the Service.</p>
                    <p>10.2 Data Bridge Hub may terminate this Agreement or terminate or suspend any Authorized User’s access or use of the Service in the following circumstances:</p>
                    <p>(a) If Customer’s or any Authorized User’s continued use of the Service or Custom Connector Service may, in Data Bridge Hub’ discretion, result in material harm to Data Bridge Hub, its subcontractors, affiliates, or another customer of the Service, Data Bridge Hub may reasonably block or restrict Customer’s access to the Service or Custom Connector Service;.</p>
                    <p>(b) if Customer or any Authorized User has (i) submitted information to the Service in violation of applicable law; (ii) accessed Custom Connector Services for which Customer or any Authorized User has no rights or in violation of the terms of such services or (iii) otherwise used the Service in breach of these Terms, including the restrictions set forth in Section 6 above;</p>
                    <p>(c) any fees due by Customer remain unpaid fifteen (15) days after the applicable due date as set forth in the Agreement; or</p>
                    <p>(d) if Customer commits a material breach of its obligations under the Agreement and does not remedy such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of breach from Data Bridge Hub.</p>
                    <p>10.3 Either party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other party if the other party enters into bankruptcy, becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>
                    <h4 class="wp-block-heading">11. Feedback</h4>

                    <p>The agreed Service delivery may include processing of personal data by Data Bridge Hub and its subcontractors, on behalf of the Customer, within the scope described in the Agreement. The purpose of this DPA is to set the terms and conditions governing such processing by Data Bridge Hub on behalf of the Customer in compliance with the requirements set by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and other applicable data protection legislation, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) (collectively, “Data Privacy Laws”).</p>
                    <p>Data Bridge Hub may process personal data only on behalf of the Customer solely to the extent necessary for the provision of the Services set forth in the Agreement, and may not otherwise process or use personal data for purposes other than those set forth in this DPA or as reasonably instructed by the Customer in writing where such instructions are consistent with the terms of the Agreement.
